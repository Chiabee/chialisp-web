通过打印歌曲歌词的完整列表来测试您对视频中概念的理解。您的结果应该类似于：

```bash

(q. "99 full nodes on the net, 99 full nodes on the net. 
Go out of town, your server goes down, 98 full nodes on 
the net." "98 full nodes on the net, 98 full nodes on the 
net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 97 full nodes 
on the net." "97 full nodes on the net, 97 full nodes on 
the net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 96 full 
nodes on the net." [...] "1 full nodes on the net, 1 full 
nodes on the net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 
0 full nodes on the net.")

```

Test your understanding of the concepts in the video by printing out the full list of the lyrics of the song. Your result should look similar to:

```bash

(q. "99 full nodes on the net, 99 full nodes on the net. 
Go out of town, your server goes down, 98 full nodes on 
the net." "98 full nodes on the net, 98 full nodes on the 
net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 97 full nodes 
on the net." "97 full nodes on the net, 97 full nodes on 
the net. Go out of town, your server goes down, 96 full 
nodes on the net." [...] "1 full nodes on the net, 1 full
